# Airplane-Crash-Using-OpenGL

The project demolition of a building by aeroplane crash is created to demonstrate OpenGLâ€™s
concepts. The scope is to use the basic primitives defined in openGL library creating complex
objects. It encompasses some of the skills learnt in our OpenGL classes such as pushmatrix(),
translate(), popmatrix(), timer function.

Graphics provides one of the most natural means of communicating with a computer, since our
highly developed 2D Or 3D pattern-recognition abilities allow us to perceive and process
pictorial data rapidly.
Computers have become a powerful medium for the rapid and economical production of
pictures. Graphics provide a so natural means of communicating with the computer that they
have become widespread.
Interactive graphics is the most important means of producing pictures since the invention of
photography and television. We can make pictures of not only the real world objects but also of
abstract objects such as mathematical surfaces on 4D and of data that have no inherent geometry.
A computer graphics system is a computer system with all the components of the general
purpose computer system. There are five major elements in system: input devices, processor,
memory, frame buffer, output devices.
